# Shared Calendar

### Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion

Hyunseo "Eileen" Lee ; Sandra Gao

### Project Description:

When coordinating an event or a schedule with multiple people (especially with different sub-groups), it is difficult for everyone to agree on a time window. In order to solve this, we aim to make a shared calendar space where you can indicate your availabilites (both private and public), see others' events, and delegate tasks/events for certain people via invite and event sharing.

### Instructions:

If ncurses isn't already installed, the user needs to download it prior to the usage.
There should be a server hosting all the sockets, so someone should have run the "make compile calendar_setup" command in the terminal.
Afterwards, anyone can run "make compile open_calendar" to log on to the shared calendar.

How does the user interact with this program? (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
